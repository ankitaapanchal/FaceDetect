**Face Recognition Project:** This project utilizes the Luxand Cloud API for face detection and recognition. It provides real-time face detection from a webcam feed and labels the detected faces.

**Setup Training Data**

To test the face recognition functionality, you need to prepare training data. Follow these steps to set up the training data:

1. Gather Images
Collect a set of images containing faces that you want to recognize. Make sure these images cover different angles, lighting conditions, and facial expressions for better training.

2. Organize Images
Organize the images into separate directories based on the individuals they represent. Each directory should contain images of a single person. Name these directories appropriately.

3. Naming Convention
Ensure that the image files within each directory follow a consistent naming convention.

5. Train the Model
Use a suitable face recognition library or framework to train the model using the prepared training data. Popular libraries include OpenCV, dlib, and face_recognition.

7. Test the Model
Once the model is trained, you can test its performance by running the face recognition project and observing its behavior with new images or webcam feed.

Running the Project

**To run the face recognition project:**

Ensure you have Go installed on your system.
Clone or download the project files.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
Build the project using the go build command.
Run the executable file generated.
Follow the on-screen instructions to observe real-time face detection and recognition.
Make sure you have a valid Luxand Cloud API key for face recognition functionality.
